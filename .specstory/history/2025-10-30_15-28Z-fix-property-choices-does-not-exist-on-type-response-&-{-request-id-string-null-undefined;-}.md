# /fix Property 'choices' does not exist on type 'Response & { _request_id?: string | null | undefined; }'. (2025-10-30 15:28Z)

/fix Property 'choices' does not exist on type 'Response & { _request_id?: string | null | undefined; }'.

The problem is that you're using the wrong OpenAI API method and model - `openai.responses.create` doesn't exist and `gpt-5` is not a valid model, so the response object doesn't have the expected structure.
